No Tumblr, But All is Well
==========================

I've got the basics working.  Markdown files are read via the github API and loaded onto the page.
I've avoided using a Framework like Backbone for the moment, and just used plain old functions.

I'm using my templating library [temple](https://github.com/JAForbes/temple).  It is definitely succinct, but
there isn't much html yet, so it hasn't show itself much.

I haven't styled the site yet at all.  I might try sass for a learning experience, but I'm not sure I want to introduce
a dependency.  I might just stick to CSS for now.

I decided not to use Tumblr for now because I am so happy with the GitHub API.  That means, for now, no-one can
follow my blog, but I will have a link to my twitter and github, so if someone wants to know when I post something, they can.
