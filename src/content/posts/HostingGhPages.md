After much tinkering with DNS settings I finally got this project to be served via github pages.

A bonus, all my other github repositories that use gh-pages (which is most of them) are being served at the same address.

So my game [Provider](provider), is being served at http://james-forbes.com/provider automagically.

Another reason for this is to check if my date stamps are working correctly.

I'm thinking of adding a comment section with some relevance validation protection too.  I've got a prototype and I'm hoping I can integrate it with Disqus.  If so I might make it a separate library for others to use.
